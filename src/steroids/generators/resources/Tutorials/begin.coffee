    Great success!

    Next up, open the config/application.coffee file. Find the steroids.config.location property, which tells our app which HTML document it should load when it starts up. Let's change it:

      steroids.config.location = "tutorial.html"

    Save the file. Then, hit enter on the Steroids console (opened via $ steroids connect), or use the command $ steroids push. You should see your app reload with further instructions.

    The following lines are the output of Bower, a package dependency management tool. Bower is configured with config/bower.json and run with

      $ steroids update

    Bower, do your job:
